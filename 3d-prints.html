        <h2>Let's talk about printing benchmarks</h2>
        
        <!-- Is this a good way to format this? I think you kept the p and q tags on the same line in class-->
        <p>
        A benchmark print is a good way to calibrate a 3D printer. According to Dr. Smith, 
          <q>I can 3D print now!</q>
        Dr. Smith is the example from class, but maybe he thinks this. More text about benchmark prints.

        <p>A 3D printer's benchmark print is also known as a "Benchy"</p>

        <p>A common benchmark print is of a small boat, like this:</p>

        <p>Or like this:</p>

        <h2>More about 3D Printing</h2>
        
        <p>Lots of things effect how a 3D print will turn out. Some of these things include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Type of filament</li>
          <li>Type of extruder on the 3D printer</li>
          <li>Temperature of the bed during the print</li>
          <li>Infill and minimum thickness</li>
        </ul>
